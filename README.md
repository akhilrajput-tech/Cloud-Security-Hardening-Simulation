# Cloud-Security-Hardening-Simulation
Cloud Security Hardening Simulation using IAM, S3, Network &amp; Logging best practices

# ☁️ Cloud Security Hardening Simulation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **Cloud Security Hardening Simulation**, focusing on identifying common cloud misconfigurations and applying security best practices to reduce risk and improve cloud security posture.

This is a **conceptual and simulation-based project** created for learning and portfolio purposes.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand common cloud security misconfigurations
- Learn cloud security hardening techniques
- Apply least privilege and secure configuration principles
- Prepare for cloud security interviews and internships

---

## 🛠️ Cloud Platform
- AWS (concepts are cloud-agnostic and apply to Azure/GCP)

---

## 🔐 Security Areas Covered

### 1️⃣ Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- Identified over-privileged IAM users and roles
- Lack of MFA on critical accounts
- Applied least privilege access model
- Enabled MFA and role-based access

---

### 2️⃣ Storage Security
- Public storage access risks
- Missing encryption at rest
- Applied private access controls
- Enabled encryption and secure policies

---

### 3️⃣ Network Security
- Open inbound rules (0.0.0.0/0)
- Unrestricted access to sensitive ports
- Applied restricted access rules
- Reduced attack surface

---

### 4️⃣ Logging & Monitoring
- Lack of visibility due to disabled logging
- Enabled cloud activity logging
- Improved monitoring for security events

---

## 🧪 Simulation Approach
- Analyzed insecure cloud configurations
- Studied potential attack impact
- Applied security hardening best practices
- Verified improved security posture conceptually

---

## 📊 Outcomes
- Better understanding of cloud security risks
- Improved hardening knowledge
- Strong foundation in cloud security concepts

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Cloud misconfigurations are a major security risk
- Least privilege is critical for cloud security
- Monitoring and logging are essential
- Security hardening reduces attack surface
